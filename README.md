# ruby_good_practices
A series of good practices that I collect over my professional life

- [Use customized exception instead of ruby-provided
exception](customized_exception_class.md)
- [Avoid external side effect in
transactions](external_side_effect_in_transaction.md)
- [Use `expect` instead of `allow` in rspec](expect_vs_allow.md)
- [Use `instance_double` instead of `double`](verify_double.md)
